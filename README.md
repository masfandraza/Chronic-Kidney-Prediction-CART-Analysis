# Chronic-Kidney-Prediction-CART-Analysis
 Chronic Kidney Disease CART Analysis - Excel Project

## Goal

To build an easy-to-understand model that helps identify CKD early by analyzing key medical indicators like hemoglobin levels.

---

## What Was Done

- Used Microsoft Excel to build a decision tree model.
- Compared two versions:
  - ✅ One **with hemoglobin (hemo)** as a predictor.
  - ❌ One **without hemo** to see its impact.
- Evaluated how accurate, simple, and useful each model was.

---

## Key Insight

Including **hemoglobin (hemo)** made a big difference:
- The model was **smaller, more accurate, and medically relevant**.
- Doctors can more easily understand and trust the results.

---

## ✅ Results

- **90% accuracy** on the test data.
- Model correctly predicted all CKD and non-CKD cases.
- Strong performance in ranking high-risk patients.
